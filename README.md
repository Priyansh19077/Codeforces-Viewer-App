# Codeforces-Visualizer-App
An android app that you can use to stalk anybody on Codeforces. Just enter the handle and you can get to know the User Information, Rating Graph, Rated Contest Details, Problems Solved by 'Difficulty' and 'Index' of that user.
It can also be used to monitor ourself and get to know what difficulty range problem we should solve to level up.
It simplies the difference between  what topics we are decent on and what needs extra attention..
